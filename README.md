Rebecca is an initiative inspired on Alpha Evolve by Google.

This was meant to be named be(s)t-a-evolve.

## How

I am using n8n + Postgres + Ollama with Docker.

## Why

The goal is to start with a n8n workflow which craft better n8n workflows and agents which crafts better agents.

If you need to ask what is an agent or n8n, you can check the links below:
